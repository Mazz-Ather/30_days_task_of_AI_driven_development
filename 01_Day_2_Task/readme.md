# Task 2 of AI Driven Development 

## Part A : Theory 

### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

#### a. Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

Using AI agents for repeated setup work saves time and reduces boring manual tasks. This allows me to focus on system design, structure, and architecture instead of small steps. Because of this, I start thinking like a system architect, not just a coder.

#### b. Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer.

The Nine Pillars teach skills like AI CLI usage, clear specifications, testing, tool integration (MCP), cloud deployment, and reusable domain knowledge. These areas are different but connected. Learning them together helps a developer grow deep skills in multiple domains, which is what makes someone an M-shaped developer.


### 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

#### a. Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

Vibe coding is fast in the beginning but becomes messy later. Since there is no plan, the project becomes hard to change, bugs appear, and structure gets confusing. After one week, the code is difficult to manage.

#### b. How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

SDD prevents these problems by starting with a clear written plan. The specification guides the AI and keeps the project structured. This makes the code easier to update and reduces mistakes.


### 3. Architecture Thinking

#### a. How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

Architecture-first thinking shifts the developer's role from just writing code to designing the whole system. The developer decides how everything connects, and the AI helps build it.

#### b. Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

Thinking in layers keeps the system clean. Layers like UI, logic, and tools are separated. This makes the system easier to fix, grow, and understand. Raw code without structure gets messy quickly.


## Part B : Practical Task

### CLI Prompt Used

```
Write a 1-paragraph specification for an email validation function. It must check for “@”, a valid domain like .com or .org, and return clear error messages.
```

### Specification Created

generate 1-paragraph specifications for email validation funtion.Insure that the input contains @, includes a valid domain (e.g., .com , .org) and provide clear error message when validation fails


## Part C — MCQs

1. **B** — Clear requirements before coding begins
2. **B** — Thinking in systems and clear instructions
3. **B** — Architecture becomes hard to extend
4. **B** — Handle repetitive tasks so dev focuses on design & problem-solving
5. **C** — Deep skills in multiple related domains

## Reflection

This task helped me understand how the developer role is changing in the AI-Native world. Using ideas like the Nine Pillars, SDD, and AI agents makes development more organised and easier to manage. Instead of only writing code, we now focus more on planning and system thinking. This helps us grow into M-shaped developers who have strong skills in multiple areas.
